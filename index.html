    <div class=hardware>
    <h4>General Hardware</h4>
    <p>Understand the components of a PC and their functions.</p>
    <h5>CPU (Central Processing Unit)</h5>
    <p>A CPU is the brain of the computer, responsible for processing instructions. It is also called the Central Processing Unit.</p>
    <p>Modern CPUs have multiple cores, allowing them to handle multiple tasks simultaneously. They are essential for running applications, games, and operating systems efficiently.</p>
    <p>When choosing a CPU, consider factors like clock speed, core count, and compatibility with your motherboard.</p>
    <p>Popular CPU brands include AMD and Intel. AMD is known for offering excellent performance at competitive prices, especially with their Ryzen series, which provides high core counts and great multitasking capabilities. AMD CPUs are often preferred by gamers and content creators for their value and performance.</p>

They also have a wide range of options for laptops and desktops.</p>
    <p>Both brands have their strengths, so your choice should depend on your specific needs and budget. I would personally recommend AMD over Intel as they have better upgradability compared to intel because of their AM4 and AM5 platforms instead of switching motherboards every few generations for new sockets.</p>
    <p>Pro tip: The best place to get a CPU is Aliexpress! You can find great deals on CPUs, especially if you're willing to wait for shipping. Just make sure to check the seller's ratings and reviews before making a purchase.</p>
     <h5>GPU (Graphics Processing Unit)</h5>
    <p>The GPU is responsible for rendering images, videos, and animations. It is crucial for gaming and graphic-intensive tasks.</p>
    <p>GPUs can be integrated (built into the CPU) or dedicated (separate hardware). Dedicated GPUs are more powerful and are recommended for gaming.</p>
    <p>When choosing a GPU, consider factors like VRAM, clock speed, and compatibility with your motherboard.</p>
    <p>Popular GPU brands include NVIDIA and AMD. NVIDIA is known for its powerful GPUs, especially in the high-end market, with features like ray tracing and DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling) that enhance gaming visuals and performance. Their GeForce RTX series is widely used by gamers and professionals alike.</p>
    <p>AMD also offers competitive GPUs, particularly in the mid-range and budget segments. Their Radeon RX series provides excellent performance for gaming and content creation, often at a lower price point than NVIDIA's offerings. AMD GPUs are also known for their good value and performance in 1440p gaming.</p>
    <p>Both brands have their advantages, so your choice should depend on your gaming preferences and budget. If you want the best performance and features, NVIDIA is a great choice. If you're looking for value and solid performance, AMD is worth considering.</p>
    <p>TL;DR: Nvidia GeForce for Ray Tracing and DLSS (AI generated frames) while AMD Radeon for FPS per Dollar (price to perforance and raw power).</p>
    <p>Pro Tip: A newer generation doesn't mean a better card! for example, a GeForce RTX 3090 is still better than an RTX 4060 because the 4060 is a budget card for 1080p Medium-Ultra settings but a 3090 is a high-end card for 1440p and maybe even 4k! On GPUs, the thousands digit is generally the generation.</p>
    <p>Pro Tip 2: If you are looking for a budget GPU, consider the used market. You can find great deals on older GPUs that still perform well for gaming. Just make sure to check the condition and warranty before buying.</p>
     <h5>RAM (Random Access Memory) or just Memory</h5>
    <p>RAM is temporary storage that allows your computer to access data quickly. It is essential for multitasking and running applications smoothly.</p>
    <p>When choosing RAM, consider factors like capacity (GB), speed (MHz), and compatibility with your motherboard.</p>
    <p>Popular RAM brands include Corsair, G.Skill, and Kingston. Corsair is known for its high-performance RAM modules, often used by gamers and enthusiasts. Their Vengeance and Dominator series are popular choices for overclocking and gaming builds.</p>

    <p>Generally, for RAM, finding two different brands of RAM for the same specs is normal. Picking the cheaper one is usually advised by many famous PC builders like ZTT but if you have more money laying around, feel free to pick a brand you trust more even if it costs you extra.</p>
    <p>Pro tip: Use dual channel RAM for better performance. Dual channel RAM is when you have two sticks of RAM with the same specs (speed, capacity, etc.) installed in the correct slots (2nd and 4th are the faster lanes) on your motherboard. This allows the RAM to work together and increases the memory bandwidth, resulting in better performance.</p>
    <h5>Motherboards</h5>
    <p>The motherboard is the main circuit board that connects all components of the computer. It houses the CPU, RAM, GPU, and other peripherals.</p>
    <p>When choosing a motherboard, consider factors like form factor (ATX, Micro-ATX, Mini-ITX), chipset, and compatibility with your CPU and RAM.</p>
    <p>Form factor refers to the size and layout of the motherboard. ATX is the standard size, while Micro-ATX and Mini-ITX are smaller options for compact builds.</p>
    <p>Chipset determines the features and capabilities of the motherboard. Higher-end chipsets offer more connectivity options, overclocking support, and better performance.</p>
    <p>Popular motherboard brands include ASUS, MSI, and Gigabyte. ASUS is known for its high-quality motherboards with excellent performance and features. Their ROG (Republic of Gamers) and TUF Gaming series is popular among gamers and enthusiasts.</p>
